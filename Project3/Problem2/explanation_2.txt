To find an element in a sorted list, we also use a similar approach to binary search, however we tweak the conditions. 
Used a pivot index where the list can be breaked into two halves.
The pivot element is the smallest element in the list.

Time Complexity: O(log(n))  
Space Complexity: O(log(n))
