This problem focuses on finding max and min values from an unsorted array, we are not required to nothing extra
and here lies the key, not being required to sort anything, we can solve the problem with
a single transversal and two placeholders, as reference for min and max values.
 
We perform a single transverse of the whole input, being the time complexity of O(n).
In respect to the space complexity, we have just a pair of pointers, hence, it is independent from input size; O(1).
