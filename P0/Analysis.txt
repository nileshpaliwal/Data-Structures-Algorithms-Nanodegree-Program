
** Task0.py **
This takes runs in __O(1)__, due to the fact that _access_ on a Python array has O(1), and there are
two lines executing accesses to lists

** Task1.py **
This takes runs in __O(n)__, due to the fact that we access sequentially both files for two of their
columns, resulting in `2*2*O(n) -> O(n)`

** Task2.py **
Time Complexity: O(n)
Description: List is looped through once


** Task3.py **
Time Complexity: O(n+nlogn)
Description: For loop and python sort


** Task4.py **
Time Complexity: O(n+nlogn)
Description: For loop and python sort
